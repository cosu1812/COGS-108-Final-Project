    "Since we attend UCSD and have experienced delicious Mexican cuisines, we were curious to see if quality of such food decreased as we traveled away from Mexico. From personal experience, members noticed that Mexican food quality in Southern California is superior to that in Northern California, concluding that this is possibly due to proximity from Mexico. To see if our hypothesis is true, we will be utilizing star ratings from Yelp can help determine whether location determines quality. Seeing if this hypothesis holds true for other cuisines, like seafood, will further test our hypothesis. This is important because customers would be able to see what restaurants are good in particular regions. Also, a company like Yelp could see how much power a restaurant rating has for that business. This tool could be used for small restaurant businesses in determining where they should build their location. So, our data would help to determine how close/far away a restaurant should be placed to be successful. \n",

    "A relevant project that relates to our project is by Tyler Knutsen, a strategist in the business industry. On his blogpost on the NYC Data Science Academy, he describes his project that explores whether Yelp reviews can predict a Michelin Star rating of a restaurant. The critics and criteria for the Michelin Star ratings are extremely secretive, so Knutsen uses the Yelp dataset to compare past and current Michelin rated restaurants, and whether the qualities of those restaurants define a high quality restaurant. His work revealed that a restaurant with a bill averaging $250 before drinks, a restaurant without reservations for months at a time, and dining experiences of +3 hours typically place a restaurant in the Michelin fine dining world. While we are not using Yelp ratings to predict the ratings of a restaurant, this is related to our project because we are using Yelp ratings to prove if there’s a relationship between proximity from the food source and ratings. We are seeing whether any correlation relates to our personal experiences and observations with food. We are utilizing similar techniques of web scraping and data analysis as Knutsen, like limiting our dataset to particular regions, parsing restaurant specific tags, and graphical analyses to display our results. \n",

    "A second relevant project that relates to our project is by a group of UCSD students (Mengqi Yu, Men Xue, and Wenjia Ouyang). This project attempts to take in Yelp datasets to accurately predict what Yelp ratings restaurants will receive in the future. To decide upon a prediction method, the group behind this project decided to use and compare three machine learning algorithms. Although quite different, our project and this project are also quite similar. The predictive project intends to find a relationship between a restaurant’s current reviews and a restaurant's future reviews, while our project intends to find a relationship between a restaurant's current reviews and a restaurant’s distance from that restaurant’s food’s original source. Additionally, our project intends to use maps and graphs similar to that of the predictive project’s. Also, our project, like the predictive project, focuses solely upon the restaurants in the dataset. \n"

    "To clean the data, we must filter the Yelp data to restaurants (not just any business) in North America through pandas’s functions for filtering dataframes.

We would compare the relationship of distance from Mexico and ratings for Mexican restaurants to the relationship of distance from ocean and ratings for seafood restaurants. We will group restaurants by either distance intervals from the type of source using longitude and latitude, or by region. With region, we can group the restaurants by city, county, or state and also see if it’s the general distance the restaurant’s region is from the source, rather than the restaurant itself, that affects the ratings.\n",

A scatter plot that graphs restaurant distance from source vs average rating will also be made to to see if there is a general trend and correlation.\n",

Additionally, because our dataset utilizes only publicly available data, there are no privacy concerns regarding our datasets. However, there are potential biases in our datasets that may be problematic. Due to being only a subset that Yelp provided us for educational purposes, our dataset does not include all of Yelp’s restaurants, and how exactly this data was collected is unknown. Thus, the restaurants in this dataset could have possibly been selected only if they met certain criteria, which would be cause for concern in terms of equitable impact. To address this issue, we will basically assume that Yelp would not intentionally heavily bias its own dataset designed for educational purposes. "

People could know that when visiting coastal regions, seafood could be a good choice and that Mexican food could also be a good choice in places like California. If our methods do not work we would research more in datasets, adjust how we use distance from source, or change what criteria we use for source. If our hypotheses are wrong then perhaps there is no real correlation between distance from source and Yelp ratings. Perhaps other factors like characteristics of the location and its population have a much bigger impact on the Yelp ratings.\n",

    "A potential pitfall is that because Yelp reviews are only up to 5, the variation in ratings across different restaurants might not be large enough to fully analyze. Also, the Yelp dataset appears to be a random subset of all the businesses there are, and seems to be more focused in certain areas. Another potential pitfall includes the fact that Yelp reviewers might rate a restaurant more so on that restaurant's other aspects (such as service and decor) than that restaurant's food. Additionally, surrounding competition might influence a Yelp review.\n"
